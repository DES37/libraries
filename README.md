## Libraries

The Processing Project List has a [section](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List#libraries) which includes libraries which have not been update for Processing 3.

* [Hype Framework](http://www.hypeframework.org/) [[GitHub](https://github.com/hype/HYPE_Processing)]

### Sound

* [[Sound]](sound)
* [Minim](minim)
* [Beads](http://www.beadsproject.net/)
* [Sonia](http://sonia.pitaru.com/)


Csound based?


### GUI

* [controlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)
* [G4P](http://www.lagers.org.uk/g4p/index.html)

### Geometry and 3D

* [Geomerative](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/)
* [Computational Geometry](http://thecloudlab.org/processing/library.html)
* [Shapes 3D](http://www.lagers.org.uk/s3d4p/index.html)
* [[HE_Mesh]](hemesh)

### Video

* Video (Processing 3)
* [PeasyCam](http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/)

At least version 3 has its own library. What are the pros and cons?

### Image Processing

* [OpenCV for Processing](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing) - not yet available in library manager for 3. Seems to come with its own OpenCV.
* [SimpeOpenNI](https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/) - requires OpenNI to be installed. Version 2!?

### Installations

* [Mother](http://www.onar3d.com/mother/) [[GitHub](https://github.com/onar3d/processing-mother)] VJ

### Projection Mapping

* [SketchMapper](https://josephtaylor.github.io/sketch-mapper/) - a reimplementation ofSurfaceMapper/SurfaceMapperGUI for Processing 2. New version would not install in P3 using manager, so got it with git, but version number is wrong. Installed with P2 manager and copied over, but conflicts wit Keystone somehow.

* [Keystone](http://www.deadpixel.ca/keystone/)[keystone (old site?)](http://keystonep5.sourceforge.net/) [[GitHub](https://github.com/davidbouchard/keystone)]

* [ProjectedQuads](http://marcinignac.com/blog/projectedquads-source-code/) - old!?

##### Projection Mapping Examples

* [Projection mapping examples in Processing](https://github.com/pixelpusher/P5ProjectionMapping) - same guy has some nice [Generative Sketches](http://p5p.cecinestpasparis.net/) and creative coding examples in repos

### Physics

* [punktiert](http://www.lab-eds.org/punktiert) - particle systems
* [Box2D for Processing](https://github.com/shiffman/Box2D-for-Processing) (Shiffman) - with usage notes in [Physics Libraries](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-5-physics-libraries/) chapter of The Nature of Code
* [Fisica](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/fisica/) - wrapper for JBox2D with more abstraction
* [MSAFluid](http://memo.tv/archive/msafluid_for_processing_v1_3) related to OpenFrameworks [ofxMFAfluid](http://www.memo.tv/ofxmsafluid/). Note uses `javax.media.opengl` which was renamed to `com.jogamp.opengl`. Can't seem to get working, nor TUIO which is needed.
* [diewald_fluid](http://thomasdiewald.com/processing/libraries/diewald_fluid/) - out of date?
* [AI for Games](http://www.lagers.org.uk/ai4g/index.html) - same developer and AI for Games and Shapes 3D.
* [bRigid](http://www.lab-eds.org/bRigid) - jBullet, same dev as punktiert.

### Collision Detection

* [Toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.org/) [[GitHub](https://github.com/postspectacular/toxiclibs)] [[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/postspectacular/toxiclibs/wiki/Home)] [[Shiffman's Fork](https://github.com/shiffman/toxiclibs)] deprecated? [Toxiclibs.js](http://haptic-data.com/toxiclibsjs) looks like it works with lots of stuff, physics plus lots more
* [Collision Detection](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection) - looks good! see also old repo ([Collision Detection Functions](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetectionFunctionsForProcessing)) and [Collision Detection](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/), a cool online book.

### Maps

* [Unfolding](http://unfoldingmaps.org/)
* [MapThing](http://www.reades.com/2013/04/01/the-mapthing-processing-library/)
